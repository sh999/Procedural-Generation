Mandelbrot equation:
	
	(x_n, y_n) = (x_n-1, y_n-1)^2 + (c_x, c_y)

	where (x_n, y_n) is called the orbit, a complex number
		x_n is the real component
		y_n is the imaginary component
	x_n-1 stands for x subscript (n-1)
	(c_x, c_y) is a constant ("c" in conventional descriptions) 
		c_x is the real component 
		c_y is the imaginary component

A mandelbrot set contains a sequence of numbers obtained by 
calculating the above equation with (x_n-1, y_n-1) = 0 and (c_x, c_y) = any possible combination
to obtain (x_n, y_n)--this becomes the first value in the set. To get the next value in the set, 
the equation is "iterated", or undergoes recursion; that is, (x_n, y_n) is put in place of (x_n-1, y_n-1)
while (c_x, c_y) is constant.

Each unique (c_x, c_y) value results in some mandelbrot set; the set can converge to some constant or
diverge to infinity.

The set is plotted on a 2d imaginary plane with reals as x-axis and imaginary number as y-axis.
Each point in the plane represents (c_x, c_y).  Each point is colored black iff the mandelbrot set
resulting from that particular (c_x, c_y) converges. Coloration popular in many depictions are determined
by the number of iterations that the equation can undergo so long as the orbit is under the magnitude of 2.

Below is from the wiki page, where for each pixel, the color of it is determined by iterating through the
equation and stopping when the distance from origin > 2. Note that notation x_n-1, y_n-1 isn't used
because of the nature of overwriting during variable assignment.

for each pixel of coordinate (c_x, c_y):
	x_n = 0	// initial condition is always 0 for both components
	y_n = 0
	iteration_limit = any custom value
	iterations = 0
	while (distance(origin, orbit) < 2 and iterations < iteration_limit):
		orbit_temp_x = (x_n)^2 - (y_n)^2 + c_x		
		y_n = 2 * (x_n) * (y_n) + c_y
		x_n = orbit_temp_x
		iterations += 1
	color (c_x, c_y) = iterations normalized
